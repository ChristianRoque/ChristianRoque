### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Currently pursuing my CS major at FIU. I had previously studied biological sciences but decided to change my career towards a more result-oriented field where I could see the impact of my work with small communities and businesses. Recently graduated from Ironhackâ€™s Web Development Bootcamp in Miami.

I'm a focused professional with proven analytical, communication, and multitasking skills. Aiming to leverage my abilities to successfully fill the Software developer role at your company. Frequently praised as adaptable by my peers, I can be relied upon to help your company achieve its goals.
